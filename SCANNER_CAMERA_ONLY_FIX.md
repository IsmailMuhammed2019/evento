# 📷 **Scanner Fixed - Camera Only Mode**

## ✅ **Scanner Updated Successfully!**

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Before:**
- ❌ **File upload options** ("Choose Image", "drop an image to scan")

- ❌ **Html5QrcodeScanner** with default file upload features

### **After:**
- ✅ **Camera-only scanning** - no file upload options
- ✅ **Clean interface** with start/stop camera buttons
- ✅ **Html5Qrcode** direct implementation for camera control
- ✅ **Better user experience** with clear camera controls

## 🎯 **New Scanner Interface:**

### **Scanner States:**

1. **Ready State:**
   - 📷 **Camera icon** with "Camera scanner ready"
   - 🔵 **"Start Camera Scanner" button**
   - Clean, simple interface

2. **Scanning State:**
   - 📷 **Animated camera icon** (pulsing blue)
   - 🔴 **"Stop Scanner" button**
   - "Scanning for QR codes..." message

3. **Processing State:**
   - ⏳ **Loading indicators** during scan processing
   - 🔄 **Automatic resume** after successful scan (if under limit)

## 🚀 **How It Works Now:**
