# 🔧 **Admin Navigation Fixed!**

## ✅ **Problem Solved!**

The admin navigation issue has been fixed. Here's what was wrong and how it's now resolved:

### 🔍 **What Was Wrong:**
- Admin pages were showing student navigation (Scanner, My Records)
- Admin should see: Daily QR, Admin Dashboard, Generate QR
- Navigation logic was based only on student login status

### ✅ **What I Fixed:**

1. **Smart Navigation Logic**: 
   - If on admin pages (`/admin/*` or `/generate`), always show admin navigation
   - Otherwise, show student navigation if student is logged in

2. **Clear Student Session Button**: 
   - Added to both admin pages
   - Allows admins to clear student session and ensure proper navigation

## 🎯 **Admin Navigation Now Shows:**

### **Admin Menu Items:**
- ✅ **Daily QR** - Generate daily QR codes
- ✅ **Admin Dashboard** - View all attendance records
- ✅ **Generate QR** - Generate individual student QR codes

### **Student Menu Items (when logged in as student):**
- ✅ **Scanner** - Scan daily QR codes
- ✅ **My Records** - View personal attendance

## 🧪 **How to Test:**

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000/admin/daily-qr
